This post goes into the definitions of the computational complexity classes P and NP as defined in the "holy grail" book 
by Garey and Johnson.

# Introduction
[Garey and Johnson's](https://www.amazon.com/Computers-Intractability-NP-Completeness-Mathematical-Sciences/dp/0716710455) 
book on computational complexity is a great read, especially for beginners and newcomers to the world of complexity theory.
Contrary to what most would think, this book is actually very beginner friendly, and does not assume advanced knowledge of
any particular niche subject like the theory of languages, graph theory, etc.
