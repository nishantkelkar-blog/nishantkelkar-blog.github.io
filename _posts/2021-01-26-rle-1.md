Run-length encoding is a popular technique for solving coding interview algorithms problems.
In this blog, we study what this technique is about, where it applies, how to think about it, and finally an example solved problem with a Java implementation.

Run-length encoding (RLE) is a popular string compression technique.
Suppose you are given the following string:

```java
String repeated = "ttthhhhisssssssss isss aaaaaan exxxxammplleeeeee";
```

Say we want to compress this string so that we don't have to store all the consecutive repeated characters as that is a waste of space.
What is a good way to perform this compression?
One idea is to do the following: replace each contiguous sequence of the same character with a tuple -- the character, and its count.

So for example, the first word in the string `repeated` above can be compressed to be:

```java
String repeatedFirstWord = "t3h4i1s9";
```

This basically says that we have 3 of `t`, 4 of `h`, 1 of `i`, and 9 of `s`.
In the same way, we can compress the remaining words of `repeated` to get an overall compressed version of the original string:

```java
String repeatedCompressed = "t3h4i1s9 i1s3 a6n1 e1x4a1m2p1l2e6";
```

Even with this naive form of compression, we can see that the compressed version is much smaller in size than the original version.
