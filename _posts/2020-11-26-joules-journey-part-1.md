We adopted Joule from the local Humane Society Silicon Valley (HSSV) in Milpitas on the 14th of October, 2019.
Back then, he was just ~8.5 weeks old.
I remember I was ecstatic, completely brimming with joy that day!
The story of how we got him is quite interesting, actually.

Soumya (my wife) and I had been planning to adopt a puppy for quite a while up until that point.
Throughout the month of September, we would stay up late at night past our bedtime and search the internet for various tips and tricks on managing the whole puppy situation.
I won't lie, it was quite overwhelming in the beginning -- taking care of a puppy wasn't as rosy and easy as we felt initially!
We religiously followed all posts by [Zac George](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ) on YouTube about his experiences raising _his_ then--recently adopted puppy Inertia.
We had closely been following Zac since around mid August actually.
Soumya even purchased his famous book [Dog Training Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Zak-Georges-Dog-Training-Revolution-ebook/dp/B015BCX05S) on Audible and made me listen to it.
Thinking back about all this, I think we spent a considerable amount of time learning about the ins and outs about being pupper parents.
We learned about the importance of not giving really young puppies too much space, about house training, human and dog socialization, and above all, the power of positive reinforcement.
If there is a single message you can take from Zac's work and honestly from any modern dog trainer, it would be -- **do not** go for a punishment based training regiment.
Prefer showing your dog what behaviors are desirable by **rewarding them generously** with their favorite treats when they behave like you want them to.
This will automatically make positive associations between actions and rewards in their brains, and they will _want_ to behave in ways that are desirable to you, simply because they get delicious food in exchange!
This draws upon the fact that dogs are extremely opportunistic animals.
They _will_ grab an opportunity to behave in a way that they want if such an opportunity presents itself.
The trick is to _align_ what they want with what you want :)

Don't use shock collars, water jet, or prong collars to punish behaviors that you do not like.
This will probably get your puppy to behave how you want them to yes, but at what cost?
Your dog will constantly be in fear whenever engaging in any activity with you.
Not knowing when they will get that next prick in the neck, or jolt of electric current, or a sharp jet of water on their snout will cause unnecessary anxiety to them.
Think what you are doing to their _mental state_ when training your dog -- it is equally important if not more, as their physical state, manners, and behavior.

I digress, however, since this post is about Joule and how our journey together began.
It was on October 13th, 2019 -- a Sunday afternoon somewhere around 3PM, when we arrived at the HSSV pet adoption center in Sunnyvale, located on E El Camino Real.
They actually operate out of a Petco outlet where they have an office space and a small puppy room in the back.
My wife and I had read on their website that 3 12--week old puppy siblings had just gotten in and were up for adoption there.
We rushed to the center as soon as we found out.
When we got there, my heart immediately sunk as I noticed 2 families already with the puppies and trying to bond with them.
After weeks of learning about puppy behavior, positive reinforcement, watching dozens of videos and reading dozens of books and articles, and applying to about half a dozen different shelters and rescues, this was the first time we were actually visiting a shelter in the flesh and blood.
And so naturally, both me and my wife were _really_ eager to meet some puppies, and so having to wait in line with the possibility that the families before us would adopt all 3 pups was a big buzz kill.
Still, all hope was not lost.
We kept reminding each other how much we wanted this, and to be patient -- that if not here, we could always adopt from some other shelter.
Eventually, one of the families left the puppy play room making way for us.
We pumped some hand sanitizer liquid onto our hands and made our way inside.

The strong smell of urine instantly hit my nostrils.
A young teenage boy had one of the 3 puppies in his lap and was gently stroking the puppy's head and back -- he did not seem to mind the urine.
Instinct instantly had me scan the floor for potential urine and indeed, a few feet away from where the other 2 puppies lay was a large pee puddle.
"OK, just make sure you dodge this area at all costs" is what I told myself.
My focus now shifted to the 2 puppies that were sleeping piled up on each other in an arbitrary manner.
They seemed quite calm and at ease.
I didn't think of waking them up, but instead decided to knee down close to them and gently pet them on their backs.
Honestly, I was just looking for _some_ way to bond with them, as was my wife.
But the puppies were being extremely dull.
If I remember correctly, one was a boy and the other was a girl.
All they seemed to be interested in was sleeping.
After sitting next to them and petting them for a good ~10 minutes, I was hoping at least one of them would lift their heads up and/or crawl nearer to me, but that did not happen.
Every once in a while one of the puppies would get up to probably readjust their position and my wife and I tried luring them with toys, animating ourselves, and other tricks to get them excited about us being in the room.
But all we got in return was yawns and glances.
As it was already, we were mindful of the pee spots within the room and to add to the confusion, one of the two pups got up and created a new puddle.
Soumya and I tried our best to get their attention one time, to lock their interest in us just once, so that we could look for the critical bond that is so important when adopting a puppy.
For a good ~45 minutes we tried and tried, but repeatedly failed.
Sleeping and peeing was all these 2 puppies were interested in, it seemed!
Toward the end, the teenage boy who had the third puppy also left, and the third sibling of this trio wasn't much different.
I think it was a boy, and he was just as drowsy as the other two, almost immediately attracted to the pile of pups to lay on it and doze off.
Finally, we decided to give up at that location for the day.
We decided to agree that it was probably bad timing on our part and it was possible that we were visiting right after their feeding time, which could explain the peeing and the sleepiness.
I planned to visit again the next day, to see if any one of them would be any different then (assuming they were still available for adoption at that point).

That day, we learned an important detail -- we found out what kind of puppy we did _not_ want.
We were so fixated on the "model puppy" that we wanted that we didn't pause to think about what kind of dog did not suite us.
We did not want a puppy that would not bond with us at an emotional level.
We did not want a puppy that would be so independent as to not really bother about whether we were present or not.
We did not want a puppy that would love to laze around all day and not be responsive to us.

We were in search for a loving, bubbly soul full of energy that would enjoy being around us, playing with us and with toys, and eager to learn from us and at the same time, teach us something.
As destiny would have it, we were to stumble upon exactly such a magnificent pupper only the very next day!

Onward to the next adventure!
