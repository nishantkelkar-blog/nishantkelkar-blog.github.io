Traditional machine learning (i.e. not deep learning) has to deal with feature selection as a problem when the number of features per data point is too large.
What happens with an explosion of features (think tens of thousands) is that we hit something called **The curse of dimensionality**.
A large number of features can also potentially lead to lesser model prediction efficacy due to the potential to introduce a lot of noise.
And finally, you do not want too many features simply because it makes the training phase of your model building slower.
