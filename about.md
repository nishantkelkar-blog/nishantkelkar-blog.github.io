## A bit about me

Hi there! My name is Nishant, and I am a software engineer in the Bay Area.
I just graduated from Georgia Tech (as of November 22nd 2020) and now I have enough free time to start my own blog.

This blog is meant to cover 4 main topics that are close to me:

- Pictures and stories of my very playful puppy Joule,
- Pictures of delicious food cooked by my lovely wife,
- Veganism and articles/data showing how going Vegan is a humane, sustainable, and healthy way forward, and
- Random Computer Science musings spanning algorithms, machine learning, and AI

I hope you enjoy my posts!
